## Overview

### What I learned

With this challenge I have been able to practice very well the media queries, the flexbox and grid. I used grid to make the google and meta testimonial cards. It was an interesting challenge since I had to see how to put a testimonial card on top of another one but a little bit moved to one side. For a first time I don't feel I did it wrong, there are probably better ways to do it.
